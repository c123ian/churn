## Project Overview
This project combines ML-based churn prediction with LLM-generated personalized retention emails for telecom customers.

## Notebook Analysis Summary

| Component | Key Findings |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Data** | 7,043 customers, 21 features, 26.6% churn rate |
| **Top Churn Factors** | Month-to-month contracts (75% churn), high charges, fiber optic, no tech support |
| **Best Models** | Voting Classifier (81.6%), Random Forest (81.3%), Logistic Regression (80.9%) |

## Email Generator App Implementation

1. **UI Risk Toggles**: Based on ML-identified factors
   ```python
   # Toggles are derived directly from ML model insights
   create_toggle("monthToMonth", "Month-to-Month Contract", checked=True)  # Strongest churn predictor
   create_toggle("fiberOptic", "Fiber Optic")  # High churn signal
   ```

2. **Strategy Mapping**: Risk factors linked to targeted solutions
   ```python
   # Each toggle triggers specific retention strategies
   RISK_FACTOR_STRATEGIES = {
       "highMonthlyCharges": ["Discount on 1-year contract", "Loyalty price reduction"],
       "fiberOptic": ["Free speed upgrade", "Enhanced reliability promise"]
   }
   ```

3. **Dynamic Prompt Construction**: Assembles personalized LLM inputs
   ```python
   # Converts UI selections into structured prompt components
   if monthly_charges > 75:
       risk_factors.append(f"High monthly charges (${monthly_charges})")
       retention_strategies.extend(RISK_FACTOR_STRATEGIES["highMonthlyCharges"])
   ```

## Key Questions & Answers

### Customer Churn Prediction
1. **Classification Performance**
   - Best: Voting Classifier (81.6% accuracy)
   - Metrics: F1 scores of 0.88 (non-churn), 0.62 (churn)

2. **Influential Factors**
   - Contract type (month-to-month vs. annual)
   - Service combinations (fiber without security)
   - Demographics (single customers churn more)
   - Payment methods (electronic check highest risk)

### Email Generation
1. **Brand Guideline Adherence**
   - Tone instructions embedded in prompts
   - Structured format with standardized signature
   - Temperature (0.7) balances consistency with personalization

2. **Scaling Potential**
   - Lifecycle-based segmentation and triggers
   - Multi-channel extension
   - A/B testing and feedback integration

## Future Improvements: ML + LLM

1. **Predict Risk**: Voting Classifier identifies customers likely to churn
2. **Explain Why**: SHAP values determine the key factors for each customer
3. **Personalize Message**: LLM generates tailored emails addressing specific factors
4. **Interface**: Both manual toggles and automated CSV batch processing

This combines predictive power (ML), explainability (SHAP), and personalization (LLM) to create targeted retention campaigns that address each customer's unique reasons for potential churn.
